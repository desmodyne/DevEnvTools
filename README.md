# DevEnvTools

A [DesmoDyne](https://www.desmodyne.com) project that provides tools focussed on the local software development environment.

The tools in this project are probably most useful when working in a distributed team. They are mostly targeted at macOS, but are intended to work cross-platform, so they might also be usable on Linux (or other *nixes), possibly with minor modifications.
