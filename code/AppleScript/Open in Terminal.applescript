# NOTE: about getting selected items from Finder (or the Desktop):
# + a Finder window will always report at least one selected item
#   as long as it is open (i.e. not minimized) and has focus
# + an open Finder window can lose focus by clicking in an empty Desktop area
# + items can also be selected on the Desktop; equivalent to Finder window

# mac OS /Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app supports four script formats:
#
# 1. Script, *.scpt file name pattern
#    compiled binary file, unsuitable for storage in version control system
# 2. Script Bundle, *.scptd package / folder name pattern with contents
#      Contents/Info.plist
#      Contents/Resources/description.rtfd/TXT.rtf
#      Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt
#    again, main.scpt is a compiled binary file
# 3. Application, *.app package / folder name pattern with contents
#      Contents/Info.plist
#      Contents/MacOS/applet
#      Contents/PkgInfo
#      Contents/Resources/applet.icns
#      Contents/Resources/applet.rsrc
#      Contents/Resources/description.rtfd/TXT.rtf
#      Contents/Resources/Scripts/main.scpt
# 4. Text, *.applescript file name pattern
#    text file, suitable for storage in version control system
#
# The last format is the only human-readable form and is therefore used to
# maintain AppleScripts in a version control system such as git; contained code
# is compiled into the binary form automatically and transparently when the
# script is called. The other formats will be used once a script is deployed.
